# Data-Visualizations-of-South-African-Economy-using-Python

## Data Set
The dataset contains information about the South Africa’s Economic
and Social Indicators e.g., GDP, Inflation Rate and Unemployment,
Economic indicators are key statistics about the economy that can
help you better understand where the economy is headed, these
indicators can help investors decide when to buy or sell
investments, analyze, and forecast how a country’s economy is
performing and have insight about consumer behavior, the dataset
was downloaded from the World Bank Open Data Website
(https://data.worldbank.org/), which contains datasets about
different countries that are tracked by the World Bank Organization.

## Code
The IDE that I will be using is Jupyter Notebook along with some
Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to extract data from the
dataset (excel or CSV file), then after the system will use Matplotlib
library to plot the different types of data visualizations that converts
the structured data into useful information to gain insight about the
South African Economy and its social factors.
